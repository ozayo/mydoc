## Some Basic

### Comments

There are two types of comments: // this is a single line comment /_ this is a multiple line comment when you have to write a lot of things _/

```javascript
// Single line comment
let name = "John";
/* 
muliptle line comment
line comment.
Somecase also use disable code parts
*/
let fullname = "Doe";
let age = 35;
```

### Variables

Variables – values that hold data to perform calculations or other operations

- **var** - most widely used. can be accessed within the function where declared. can be reassigned.
- **const** – constant value i.e. cannot be reassigned
- **let** – can be used only within the block its declared, can be reassigned

### Data types

Can be of different types

- Number, eg. `var id = 20`
- Unassigned variable, eg. `var x`
- String, eg. `var company = “hackr”`
- Boolean, eg. `var windowopen = true`
- Constants. eg. `const counter = 1`
- Operations, eg. `var sum = 20 + 20`
- Objects, eg. `var student =` Contains single object of various data types

### Arrays

Arrays group similar kinds of data together. Eg, `var subjectlist = [“math”, “science”, “history”, “computer”];` Arrays can perform the following functions:

| Functions     | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| concat()      | Concatenate different arrays into one.                        |
| join()        | Joins all the elements of one array as a string               |
| indexof()     | Returns the index (first position) of an element in the array |
| lastindexof() | Returns the last position of an element in the array          |
| sort()        | Alphabetic sort of array elements                             |
| reverse()     | Sort elements in descending order                             |
| valueof()     | Primitive value of the element specified                      |
| slice()       | Cut a portion of one array and put it in a new array          |
| splice()      | Add elements to an array in a specific manner and position    |
| unshift()     | Add new element to the array in the beginning                 |
| shift()       | Remove first element of the array                             |
| pop()         | Remove the last element of the array                          |
| push()        | Add new element to the array as the last one                  |
| tostring()    | Prints the string value of the elements of the array          |

### Operators

#### Basic

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiply (\*)
- Divide (/)
- Remainder (%)
- Increment (++)
- Decrement (--)
- Execute brackets first (…)

#### Logical

- And (&&)
- Or (||)
- Not (|)

#### Comparison

- Equal to (==)
- Equal value and type (===)
- Not equal (!=)
- Not equal value or type (!==)
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than or equal to (<=)
- Ternary operator (?)

#### Bitwise

- AND (&)
- OR (|)
- NOT (~)
- XOR (^)
- Left shift (<<)
- Right shift (>>)
- Zero fill right shift (>>>)
