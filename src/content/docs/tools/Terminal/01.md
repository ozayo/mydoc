In your development process, you'll undoubtedly be required to run some commands in the terminal (or on the "command line" — these are effectively the same thing). This article provides an introduction to the terminal, the essential commands you'll need to enter into it, how to chain commands together, and how to add your own command line interface (CLI) tools.

A large number of tools can be used by typing commands into the command line; many come pre-installed on your system, and a huge number of others are installable from package registries. Package registries are like app stores, but (mostly) for command line based tools and software. We'll see how to install some tools later on in this chapter, and we'll learn more about package registries in the next chapter.

One of the biggest criticisms of the command line is that it lacks hugely in user experience. Viewing the command line for the first time can be a daunting experience: a blank screen and a blinking cursor, with very little obvious help available on what to do.

On the surface, they're far from welcoming but there's a lot you can do with them, and we promise that, with a bit of guidance and practice, using them will get easier! This is why we are providing this chapter — to help you get started in this seemingly unfriendly environment.

## What does the terminal look like?

Below you can see some of the different flavors of programs that are available that can get you to a terminal.

The next images show the command prompts available in Windows — there's a good range of options from the "cmd" program to "powershell" — which can be run from the start menu by typing the program name.

## How do you access the terminal?

Many developers today are using Unix-based tools (e.g. the terminal, and the tools you can access through it). Many tutorials and tools that exist on the web today support (and sadly assume) Unix-based systems, but not to worry — they are available on most systems. In this section, we'll look at how to get access to the terminal on your chosen system.

### Linux/Unix

As hinted at above, Linux/Unix systems have a terminal available by default, listed among your Applications.

### macOS

macOS has a system called Darwin that sits underneath the graphical user interface. Darwin is a Unix-like system, which provides the terminal, and access to the low-level tools. macOS Darwin mostly has parity with Unix, certainly good enough to not cause us any worries as we work through this article.

The terminal is available on macOS at Applications/Utilities/Terminal.

### Windows

As with some other programming tools, using the terminal (or command line) on Windows has traditionally not been as simple or easy as on other operating systems. But things are getting better.

Windows has traditionally had its own terminal-like program called cmd ("the command prompt") for a long time, but this definitely doesn't have parity with Unix commands, and is equivalent to the old-style Windows DOS prompt.
